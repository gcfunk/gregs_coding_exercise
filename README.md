# Gregs Coding Exercise

Hello interviewers! Thank you for the opportunity to demonstrate some skills, and hopefully we'll have some fun along the way.

First up, documentation! I'm a big proponent of good documentation as a kindness to the next developer that picks up the code that I write for maintenance or adding features. Sometimes the next developer is me, and it pays dividends to write down my thinking at the time. This readme doc, plus comments in the code serve as example documentation.

Follow the instructions below to run and view the app. Then notice the following:

Dogs page:

* Shrink your screen and notice how it responsds to various screen sizes
* It has pretty good keyboard accessibility. Tab to select a link and Enter to click it.

Small exercises page:

* the delay and animateRight examples are demonstrated with buttons to click on

Unit tests:

* removeDuplicates is demonstrated via unit tests. There's an intentionally failing test to show the limitations of the solution.

## Setup

Required software:

* node - [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

Open a terminal (git bash on Windows or Terminal app on Mac) and enter the following commands:

`$ git clone git@github.com:gcfunk/gregs_coding_exercise.git`

`$ npm install`

## Running the code

`$ cd gregs_coding_exercise`

`$ npm start`

Open a web browser to [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/)

## Unit tests

`$ cd gregs_coding_exercise`

`$ npm run test`

## Skills demonstrated

2. Copy / Pasting code from the internet and having opinions about it (delay example)
3. CSS animations and browser implications (animateRight example)
4. Unit tests (removeDuplicates example)
5. Understanding of javascript data types (removeDuplicates example)
6. Responsive layouts
7. Keyboard accessibility
8. Working with data from an API
