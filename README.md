# Gregs Coding Exercise

Hello interviewers! Thank you for the opportunity to demonstrate some skills, and hopefully we'll have some fun along the way.

First up, documentation! I'm a big proponent of good documentation as a kindness to the next developer that picks up the code that I write for maintenance or adding features. Sometimes the next developer is me, and it pays dividends to write down my thinking at the time. This readme doc, plus comments in the code serve as example documentation.

## Setup

Required software:

* node - [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

Open a terminal (git bash on Windows or Terminal app on Mac) and enter the following commands:

`$ git clone git@github.com:gcfunk/gregs_coding_exercise.git`

`$ cd gregs_coding_exercise`

`$ npm install`

## Running the code

`$ cd gregs_coding_exercise`

`$ npm start`

Open a web browser to [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/)

## Skills demonstrated

1. Documentation (comments and markdown documents)
2. Copy / Pasting code from the internet and having opinions about it (delay example)
